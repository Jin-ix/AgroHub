Forecasting, Exponential smoothing for seasonal data, exponential smooThe mean forecast method predicts future values as the average of all past observations. It's one of the simplest forecasting methods.

Example:
Suppose we have monthly sales data for the past 6 months: [100, 120, 130, 115, 140, 125]. The mean forecast for the next month would be:
